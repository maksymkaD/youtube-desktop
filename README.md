# Desktop YouTube App 

Simple Electron application with URL https://www.youtube.com/ in `<webview>` tag. Easy to install (if you already have Nodejs installed). This is actually pretty useless, but you can use it if you don't like opening a browser or something idk... ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯   

## Installation

Install npm packages:
```bash
npm install
```
Build the installer file for Windows:
```bash
npm run dist
```
